## Built With

<!--- Provide a list of the frameworks used to build this application, your list should include the name of the framework used, the url where the framework is available for download and what the framework was used for, see the example below --->

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend Framework
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Backend Framework
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework

## Unit Testing Summary

The application was tested using Jest and React Testing Library. Tests were written for all major components to verify functionality and isolation. Key components tested include:

App.js: Integration test ensuring routing to all pages (/, /about, /projects, /resume, * for 404). Mocking was used to prevent nested router errors.

Header.js: Unit test to verify all navigation <Link> components are present and point to the correct paths.

Footer.js: Unit test to verify the display of the copyright year and the correct structure of external links (href with https://).

Home.js/About.js/Resume.js: Verification of key structural elements, headings, and presence of profile data.

Projects.js: Integration test verifying component state management by simulating a card click and asserting that the project data correctly renders inside the modal.

## Sources Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any interpretation of someone else's code, then provide a list of where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.

### Footer.js

*Line 25*

```
Copy and paste your code on lines mentioned 
<a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/hardware" title="hardware icons">Hardware icons created by meaicon - Flaticon</a>
```

The code above was copied from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/hardware) as shown below: 

```
Copy and paste the snippet of code you are referencing
<a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/hardware" title="hardware icons">Hardware icons created by meaicon - Flaticon</a>
```

- <!---Why---> This code was provided by Flaticon to give credit to the icon creator. The icon was used extensively throughout the site to enhance visual appeal.
- <!---How---> The code was implemented by adding the HTML anchor tag with the appropriate href and title attributes to the Footer.js component.

### src/pages/Home/Home.css

*Lines 7 - 16*

``` CSS
    .gradient-border-wrapper {
    position: relative; 
    width: 100%; /* Take up the full width of its Bootstrap column */
    padding-top: 100%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    border-radius: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;

    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #55a9f3, #2787FF); /* Light blue to darker blue */
}
```

The code above was created by adapting the code from [CSS Tricks:  Perfect Square] (https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/making-a-responsive-css-square/) as shown below:

``` CSS
.box {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
}

.box:before {
    content: "";
    display: block;
    padding-top: 100%;
}
```

<!---How---> The code was implemented by using the padding-top: 100% trick on a block element to force its height to match its width, thus maintaining a perfect square aspect ratio regardless of screen size.

<!---Why---> This method was used to ensure the image grid cards remained perfectly square and responsive, a requirement not easily met using fixed pixel dimensions or simpler CSS methods.

## Artificial Intelligence Tools Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any Artificial Intelligence Tools or Plugins, then provide a list of the tools or plugins used, the prompt used, the code generated by the AI, where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.

* [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) - Gemini - Used to generate code snippets and assist with debugging code and the toolchain. I also used Gemini to generate concept images of what I wanted the portfolio site to look like.
* [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - ChatGPT - Used to explain concepts regarding React and JavaScript, and frontend and backend development.


### Prompt Used on *Gemini*

``` txt
Copy and paste the prompt used 
How do I structure routing in a React application using React Router to include a header and footer that persist across all pages, with routes for Home, About, and Projects pages?
```

The code prompt above was used to generate the code shown below: 

``` JS
Copy and paste the entirety of the code generated by the AI Tool listed above.
// In App.js
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './pages/Home';
import About from './pages/About';
import Projects from './pages/Projects';
import Header from './components/Header';
import Footer from './components/Footer';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Header /> 
      <main>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
          <Route path="/projects" element={<Projects />} />
        </Routes>
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

#### App.js
*All Lines*

``` JS
Copy and paste your code on the lines mentioned
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Header from './components/Header/Header';
import Footer from './components/Footer/Footer';
import Home from './pages/Home/Home';
import About from './pages/About/About';
import NotFound from './pages/NotFound/NotFound';
import Projects from './pages/Projects/Projects';
import Resume from './pages/Resume/Resume';

function App() {
  return (
    /* Wrap your whole app in BrowserRouter */
    <BrowserRouter> 
      <div className="d-flex flex-column min-vh-100">
        <Header /> 
        {/* Define the main content area */}
          {/* Define the available routes */}
          <main className="flex-grow-1">
            <Routes>
              <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
              <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
              <Route path="/projects" element={<Projects />} />
              <Route path="/resume" element={<Resume />} />

              {/* Catch-all route for 404 Not Found */}
              <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
            </Routes>
        </main>
        <Footer />
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
    
  );
}

export default App;
```

- <!---How---> The code was implemented by wrapping the entire application in a <BrowserRouter> component, placing the <Header> and <Footer> components outside the <Routes> to ensure they persist across all pages, and defining individual <Route> components for each page within the <Routes>.
- <!---Why---> [NAME](link)'s Code was used because it provided a clear and concise structure for implementing routing in a React application, ensuring persistent header and footer components.
- <!---How---> [NAME](link)'s Code was modified by adding additional routes for Resume and NotFound pages, and incorporating Bootstrap classes for layout styling.
